# ML Model Explorer App
==========================

## Introduction
---------------

The ML Model Explorer App is a web-based application that allows users to explore different machine learning models and datasets. The app provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a dataset and a classifier, and then trains and evaluates the model on the selected dataset.

## Features
------------

* Select from three datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine
* Choose from three classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest
* Adjust hyperparameters for each classifier using interactive sliders
* Visualize the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Evaluate the performance of the selected model using accuracy score

## How to Use
--------------

1. Select a dataset from the dropdown menu on the left sidebar.
2. Choose a classifier from the dropdown menu on the left sidebar.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters for the selected classifier using the interactive sliders on the left sidebar.
4. Click the "Run" button to train and evaluate the model.
5. View the accuracy score and visualization of the dataset on the right side of the app.

## Deployment
-------------

The app is deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed at:

## Technical Details
--------------------

* The app is built using Python and the Streamlit library.
* The datasets are loaded from scikit-learn.
* The classifiers are implemented using scikit-learn.
* The hyperparameters are adjusted using Streamlit's interactive widgets.
* The visualization is created using Matplotlib.
